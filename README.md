# 👋 Hello World, I’m Fabel Seba

🧠 Full-Stack Web Dev | 🧪 Bug Hunter | 🤖 AI Tinkerer | 🏀 Part-time Baller  
👨‍💻 I build stuff. Sometimes it even works on the first try.

## 🚀 Who's This Guy?

I’m Fabel — a **full-stack developer** with over **5 years of experience** turning coffee into code.  
I build sleek, scalable, and sensible apps using:

- ⚛️ `React` / `React Native`
- 🌐 `Next.js` + `TailwindCSS`
- 🐍 `Python`, `Django Rest Framework`, `Django-Ninja`
- 🧪 `Selenium` for testing and scraping (to my will)
- 🔥 `Supabase` (because serverless is life)

I’ve crafted everything from **SaaS platforms** to **real estate management software** — all with clean code and good vibes.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack I Actually Use

```ts
const stack = {
  frontend: ["React", "Next.js", "TailwindCSS"],
  backend: ["Python", "Django", "Django Ninja", "Supabase"],
  automation: ["Selenium"],
  mobile: ["React Native"],
};
